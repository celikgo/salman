# salman-core

Core types shared by every other salman crate.

This crate holds the things that must mean exactly one thing across the whole
platform: the project version, the safety posture, the value and time models,
and the capability registry that generates salman's status table.

Nothing here opens a socket or reads a file. It is the vocabulary the rest of
the workspace is written in.

## Part of salman

[salman](https://github.com/celikgo/salman) is a vendor-neutral, text-first,
git-native workbench for IEC 61131-3 PLC engineering. Structured Text compiles
and runs on a deterministic runtime, and its tests run headless in CI with no
vendor licence.

**Version 0.1.0, pre-alpha.** The interface will change.
[`docs/CONFORMANCE.md`](https://github.com/celikgo/salman/blob/main/docs/CONFORMANCE.md)
states exactly what is implemented and what is tested.

## Not a safety tool

salman is an engineering and diagnostic tool. It is **not** a safety PLC, is not
certified under IEC 61508, IEC 62061 or ISO 13849, and must never be used to
design, validate or replace a safety function. See
[`LEGAL.md`](https://github.com/celikgo/salman/blob/main/LEGAL.md).
